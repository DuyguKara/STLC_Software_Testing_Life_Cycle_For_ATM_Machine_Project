# Software Testing Life Cycle For ATM Machine Project
For ATM machine project testing, I use Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC), which is a process 
used to test software and ensure quality standards are met. Below you can see the stages I took 
into consideration throughout the project.

## Phases
1. Requirement Analysis
2. Test Planning
3. Test case development
4. Test Environment setup
5. Test Execution
6. Test Cycle closure

## Overview
Throughout this project you will find various documents in pdf.
To manage the ATM project testing process, I first conducted a requirements analysis.
I determined the types of tests that could be used for the project and I set priorities for testing.
Then, I prepared the test plan and determined the tool and environment in which the test would be performed. I created test objectives and strategies for tests.
I prepared an effort estimate for the test and simulated distributing responsibilities and roles to the necessary people throughout the process. If training is required, I prepared the training plan.
I prepared test scenarios and test cases by following the document format and rules required for the project. For a better understanding of the project, I supported it using high level representation.
I created appropriate test data for the implementation of the test scenarios and test cases of the project. I determined the software and hardware needs for the project.
I ran smoke tests on the installed environment project with the test data created and created the necessary tables according to the results.
These tables: 
Log Defects For Failed Cases Table, Completed RTM Matrix With The Execution Status, Business Requirement Document (BRD), Technical Requirement Document (TRD), RTM In Testing, Test Cases Table Updated With Results.
Finally, I reported the final version of the tests at the last stage of STLC. This report summarizes:
It includes the entire testing process and comparisons between expected results and actual results.
These comparisons; It includes goals achieved, time spent, total costs, test coverage, and defects.
